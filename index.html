<p>
My name is Yap Jia Qian. I am a student of Dunman High School. I am currently in 1st year of high school. I am in class 1 Jenlious. I am previously from Fengshan Primary School and was in class 6A. I can to Dunman High together with 3 of my friends from Fengshan.</p>
<p>I am interested in stationeries and I have lots of stationery collections at home. I also like to surf the internet and go on instagram and other social media. I also like to do Art & Craft with recycled materials such as cardboard. I love doing DIYs.</p>
<p>
  Currently, I have not many significant achievements in Dunman because I am only here for a few monthes. But one achievement of me is that I have change from what I think my CCA, NPCC to be a worse CCA to now being pround to be a NPCC's Cadet and thus, I think that is one achievement in myself in the past few months.</p>
